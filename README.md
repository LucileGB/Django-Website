This is a web app using Django and SQlite. Its aim is to allow users to create, edit or delete requests for reviews about books and articles.

People can follow other users to see their requests or answer their tickets with reviews.

## SETTING UP YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND LAUNCHING THE PROJECT
To launch the project, first download the relevant files. Once you've installed the virtual environment of your choice, please install the content of requirement.txt:

> python manage.py makemigrations

> python manage.py migrate

To be able to interact with the app, you will need to create a superuser. To do so, type the following once migration is done:

> python manage.py createsuperuser

You can now interact with the app as described below.

**If you wish to keep the test database, please proceed below**.
